Project Title: Unsupervised Learning and Customer Segmentation
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on unsupervised learning techniques for customer segmentation. The project aims to divide bank customers into segments based on their attributes, facilitating targeted marketing strategies.

Business Problem
In the banking industry, understanding customer behavior is crucial for personalized marketing campaigns, particularly for loan products. This project addresses the challenge of segmenting customers effectively to tailor marketing tactics, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful loan campaigns.

Objectives
