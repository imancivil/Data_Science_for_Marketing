# Project Title: Unsupervised Learning and Customer Segmentation
___

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on unsupervised learning techniques for customer segmentation. The project aims to divide bank customers into segments based on their attributes, facilitating targeted marketing strategies.

## Business Problem
In the banking industry, understanding customer behavior is crucial for personalized marketing campaigns, particularly for loan products. This project addresses the challenge of segmenting customers effectively to tailor marketing tactics, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful loan campaigns.

## Objectives
+ Retrieve and preprocess the dataset.
+ Explore the data through descriptive analysis and visualization.
+ Perform unsupervised learning using K-means clustering.
+ Evaluate the clustering model's performance.
+ Iterate over the model with additional features for improved segmentation.
+ Visualize the clusters for better understanding.
+ Draw insights and implications for marketing strategies.
## Contents
1. #### Data: Contains the dataset (Bank_Loan_1.csv) used in the project.
2. #### Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks (Customer_Segmentation.ipynb) containing the code for data preprocessing, exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
3. #### README.md: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, instructions, and usage guidelines.
4. #### License: MIT License file for open-source usage and distribution.
